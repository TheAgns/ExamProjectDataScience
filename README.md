# Step 1
# Folder structure:
📁Data folder: Includes all data scraped and cleaned data we are working with
📁Models: Includes the result from our models saved as pickles, to use in our frontend visualiaztion and to compare the models.
📁fetch: Our .py script where we scrape data from Trustpilot
📁Streamlit: Our frontend visualization with logistic regression using streamlit, guide how to run it is inside Streamlit -> readme

# Step 2
The challenge we would like to address is to compare the sentiment of customer evaluations for organizations/businesses using sentiment analysis and topic modeling on customer reviews from Trustpilot and then use logistic regression with our data and try to predict an unknown sentence that the model havn't seen before.

## Interesting study objective
Customer evaluations are a crucial source of information for organizations to understand the experiences of their clients and to pinpoint areas in need of development. Topic modeling may assist to find the main themes or subjects that consumers are discussing, while sentiment analysis can help to automatically categorize reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. Comparing the tone of customer evaluations for various firms may reveal insightful information about customer preferences and assist companies in gauging their performance against that of their rivals. 

## Expected Solution
A Python program that employs NLP methods to do sentiment analysis and topic modeling on customer reviews of companies on Trustpilot is the anticipated solution. The program would also contrast the tone of customer evaluations for the companies and display the findings using a variety of data visualization tools, including Neo4j, word clouds, bar charts, line graphs, heat maps, scatter plots and more.

## Impact and beneficiaries
The solution can offer insightful information on customer attitude and popular themes, which can help businesses better understand their clientele, identify areas for development, and assess their performance against that of their rivals. Business owners, marketers, customer care agents, and data analysts are among the stakeholders that potentially gain from this solution.

## Further development/improvements 
Build a bot for a target platform, like Discord or Reddit, that reacts and replies to negative or positive comments. This would automate getting in touch with customers who could use support to improve their experience or elicit further feedback.

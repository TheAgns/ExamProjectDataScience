Sentiment Analysis

The challenge we would like to address is to compare the sentiment of customer evaluations for organizations/businesses using sentiment analysis and topic modeling on customer reviews from Trustpilot.

Importance/Interesting study objective: Customer evaluations are a crucial source of information for organizations to understand the experiences of their clients and to pinpoint areas in need of development. Topic modeling may assist to find the main themes or subjects that consumers are discussing, while sentiment analysis can help to automatically categorize reviews as good, negative, or neutral. Comparing the tone of customer evaluations for various firms may reveal insightful information about customer preferences and assist companies in gauging their performance against that of their rivals.

Expected Solution: A Python program that employs NLP methods to do sentiment analysis and topic modeling on customer reviews of companies on Trustpilot is the anticipated solution. The program would also contrast the tone of customer evaluations for the companies and display the findings using a variety of data visualization tools, including word clouds, bar charts, line graphs, heat maps, scatter plots and more.

Impact and beneficiaries: The solution can offer insightful information on customer attitude and popular themes, which can help businesses better understand their clientele, identify areas for development, and assess their performance against that of their rivals. Business owners, marketers, customer care agents, and data analysts are among the stakeholders that potentially gain from this solution.

Extra:
Bot: Build a bot for a target platform, like Discord or Reddit, that reacts and replies to negative or positive comments. This would automate getting in touch with customers who could use support to improve their experience or elicit further feedback.
